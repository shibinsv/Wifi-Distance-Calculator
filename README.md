Application that connects with the GCP to get the coordoinates of the wifi mac-address.

Note: Current estimation is wrong and still being worked upon.

Possible solutions:
1. Calculate the Real-Time Disatnce  using Wifi-RTT - https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/wifi-rtt
2. Finding it using RSSI(which needs to be made by many calculations) form Wifi-Manager as in Indoor Localization.
